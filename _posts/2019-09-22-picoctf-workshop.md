InfoSecIITR is an open group and the information security team at IIT Roorkee. We actively take part in national and international level CTFs and won about *â‚¹ 7,00,000* last year and get qualified for on-site finals to places like Goa, Bengaluru, Pune, Kollam, Vadodara in India and *Bucharest, Romania and St. Petersberg, Russia*.

To encourage the students at IITR to participate in hacking competitions, also known as CTF(Capture The Flag). We will recognize and reward a few players according to their performance at an upcoming online CTF, the picoCTF-2019.

The picoCTF is a beginner-friendly CTF organized by Carnegie Mellon University(CMU). The picoCTF aims to introduce the primary hacking methodologies through challenges belonging to a few categories such as cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, binary exploitation. We recommend this CTF to the students interested in exploring Information Security.

picoCTF 2019 starts on 27th September, and the registration link for the competition can be found at [https://www.picoctf.com/](https://www.picoctf.com/)

To introduce the students to the way of approaching challenges in a CTF and the concepts involved in it. We are organizing workshops on 24th and 25th of September 2019 at ECE auditorium from 6:30-8:00 P.M where we will walk you through the past year challenges of picoCTF 2018.

We will reward the **top 3 participants from IIT Roorkee** according to the scoreboard of picoCTF as of 2nd October 11:59 P.M with exciting **swag and prizes**. If participating, kindly fill the google form with your IITR's official IDs, so that we can recognize and consider you for the prizes.
